<h2> Algebra is the branch of mathematics that involves the use of variables to form expressions. It involves variables like x, y, and operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Algebra is the foundation of all future topics, and is essential to understand and solve problems.</h2>

<v1><i>- Variables:</i> Variables are unknown values used in mathematical equations. Usually in a problem with a variable you have to substitude that variable with a given numerical value. In some other problems you need to find the value of the variable. Example: x + 4 = 10 -> x = 6</v1>
